DIRECTIVE: ${ROMEO.include services/graphite.yaml}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
this will include the file /etc/hostdb/includes/services/graphite.yaml in the
current yaml file. The file will be imported at the current indent level so
that you may use this include directive within another block:
-SERVICE:
    ${ROMEO.include custom/production/my_service_defintion.yaml}

Also includes may themselves inlcude other data sources.



DIRECTIVE: ${ROMEO.merge_lists *some_list1,*some_list2}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
this directive will merge mutltiple arrays into one array.
this can be usefull if you want to include multiple source files that
each define an array of interest. because yaml does not support
array merging natively you can use this directive to achive this. in this
example we can take the following inputs and expect the following output:
usage:
MY_LIST: ${ROMEO.merge_lists *some_list1,*some_list2}

inputs: 
SERVICE_GROUP: &some_list1
   - a
   - b
   - c

SERVICE_GROUP: &some_list2
   - d
   - e
   - f

output:
MY_LIST: [a,b,c,d,e,f]


DIRECTIVE: ${ROMEO.merge_lists *some_list1,*some_list2}




DIRECTIVE: ${ROMEO.decrypt some_method_lookup_string,some_method_arg1,some_method_arg2,...}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
this directive supports arbitrary decryption methods that must be
registered as plugins in romeo.decryption.  your data is not 
automatically decrypted in memory.  to use this feature you must use the
method ``decrypt`` in romeo.decryption and pass the entire directive sting
as the only argument to this method.  if the directive was not seen during
the pre-processing phase the input will be returned to the caller.



DIRECTIVE: ${ROMEO.decrypt rsa,/etc/pki/droned/local.public,a613455dbdf788604052e5035edbcd23b976b1d028fb046267c5a1a73b00304d2fcd....}
