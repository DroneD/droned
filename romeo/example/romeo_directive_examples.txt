DIRECTIVE: ${ROMEO.include services/graphite.yaml}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
this will include the file /etc/hostdb/includes/services/graphite.yaml in the
current yaml file. The file will be imported at the current indent level so
that you may use this include directive within another block:
-SERVICE:
    ${ROMEO.include custom/production/my_service_defintion.yaml}

Also includes may themselves inlcude other data sources.



DIRECTIVE: ${ROMEO.merge_lists *some_list1,*some_list2}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
this directive will merge mutltiple arrays into one array.
this can be usefull if you want to include multiple source files that
each define an array of interest. because yaml does not support
array merging natively you can use this directive to achive this. in this
example we can take the following inputs and expect the following output:
usage:
MY_LIST: ${ROMEO.merge_lists *some_list1,*some_list2}

inputs: 
SERVICE_GROUP: &some_list1
   - a
   - b
   - c

SERVICE_GROUP: &some_list2
   - d
   - e
   - f

output:
MY_LIST: [a,b,c,d,e,f]
