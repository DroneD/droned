What is DroneD?
---------------

DroneD is a service container geared towards application management and monitoring. It provides a rich API for implementing services and messaging interfaces. It is built on the Twisted framework, and utilizes the BlasterProtocol for network communication. DroneD is currently used as the management framework for all components of the Orbitz Flight Search Farms.


Service-Oriented Architecture
-----------------------------

The DroneD service API provides several useful facilities to service authors such as an event model, persistent state attributes, logging, run control, macromanagement, automatic monitoring interface, and a highly scalable client messaging interface.

Since behavior is encapsulated in services, a DroneD server can perform whatever set of tasks you require by configuring the appropriate services. By using EON, DroneD faciliates both micromanagement and macromanagement. Because of the BlasterProtocol, managing thousands of hosts in a single environment is fast, reliable, and easy.


Domain-specific packages
------------------------

Originally DroneD was developed to manage the Orbitz Flight Search farms. However all of the Orbitz-specific functionality resides in a set of modules that are packaged independently and not distributed with the core of DroneD.

-----------

DroneD requires the following components.

python2.5+ 
twisted 8.2.0+ (You will need twisted.internet.endpoints from twisted 10.1+)
